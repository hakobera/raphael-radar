ono/raphael-radar
=================

ono/raphael-radar is refactored version of
[Raphael-Radar](https://github.com/tnzk/Raphael-Radar)

The objectives of refactoring are...

* Work with the latest version of Raphael.
* Easy customization. Especially for cosmetic changes.
* Fix some bugs.
* Support multiple groups of scores.
* Remove unrequired code as a library and put the idea into example.
* Make the code simpler.

Please note that there is no compatibility with the original version.

Example
-------

Althogh it is still alpha phase, you can see code working.

[Example](http://o1123.com/raphael-radar/example/index.html)

I am thinking of making the page nicer and adding an example to handling events
on the chart. 

TODO
----

* Set attributes for scores with arguments.
* Better example page.
* Bit more document.
* Lincense information.

Special Thanks to
-----------------

* KURAZEKO Kyohe for original version.
* Yoshihide Tsuda for desigining a rich version of sample chart.
