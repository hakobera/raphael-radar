=================

ono/raphael-radar is a refactored version of
[Raphael-Radar](https://github.com/tnzk/Raphael-Radar)

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/ono/raphael-radar/raw/master/example/images/screenshot.png)

The objectives of refactoring are...

* Work with the latest version of Raphael.
* Easy customization. Especially for cosmetic changes.
* Fix some bugs.
* Support multiple groups of scores.
* Remove unnessesary code from the library and put the idea into example.
* Make the code simpler.

Please note that there is no compatibility with the original version.

Example
-------

Seeing example is always the best way to understand how it works. Here is an
[example code](http://o1123.com/raphael-radar/example/index.html).

I am thinking of making the page nicer and adding an example to handling events
on the chart near future.

TODO
----

* Accept Raphael attributes for scores.
* Better example page with code view.
* Lincense information.

Special Thanks to
-----------------

* KURAZEKO Kyohe for original version.
* Yoshihide Tsuda for desigining a rich version of sample chart.
